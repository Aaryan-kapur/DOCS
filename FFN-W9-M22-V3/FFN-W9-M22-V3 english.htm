<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Dear learners, we have now come to part three
of anti-nutritional factors. We have discussed briefly in the earlier parts of
the module, about anti-nutrients in foods their classification based on
specific action and different anti-protein, anti minerals, and anti vitamin
compounds in foods. The role of each of these in interfering with the digestion
and utilization of nutrients is explained. We shall now be studying on some
more toxic constituents in foods, and their elimination process. HIPAA to not
included in the classification discussed in part one and part two of this
module.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> Now, this part of the module deals with toxic
constituents and their biological effects and elimination of antinutritional
substances. Some of the anti-nutritional compounds in food with their
biochemical effects are summarized in the following table one. Let us now see
the different anti-nutrients their occurrence and biochemical effects. Now the
first one is saponins, it occurs in legumes such as soya bean, peas and beans,
and the biochemical effects that are seen are it forms complexes with proteins
and lipids, possesses a hemolytic effect and is known to be a gastrointestinal
irritant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now the anti-nutrient glucosinolates it occurs
in broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage cauliflower and soya bean contains
glycosides called goitrogens. The biochemical effects that are seen are they
produce toxic component isothiocyanates, then they also produce goitrogens that
cause the thyroid gland to grow by inhibiting the iodine uptake. Then the third
anti-nutrient we see here is amylase inhibitor. Now, amylase inhibitors are
seen in cereals, that is rye, triticale and barley. The biochemical effects
show that they prevent the action of enzymes that break the glycosidic bonds of
starches and other complex carbohydrates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Next, we come to tannins. Tannins are present
in coffee, tea, wine, grapes, cranberries, strawberries, blueberries, apples,
apricots, barley, peaches, dry fruits, mint and basil. Now the biochemical
effects seen, because of the presence of tannins in food is they inhibit the
activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin amylase and lipase, then they decrease
the quality of foods, and they interfere with the dietary iron absorption. The
next one is cyanogenic glucosides. Now, these are generally found in millet,
maize, oil bean seeds and cassava. And the known biochemical effect is, they
are inhibitors of cell respiration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now let us see how these anti-nutritional
substances present in foods, can be eliminated by some simple processes. Now
some of these plant chemicals have been shown to be deleterious to health or
evidently advantages to human and animal health if consumed after adequate
processing.  The chemical and physical characteristics of the anti-nutritional
factors, determine the choice of appropriate treatment that is used to
eliminate the undesirable compound from foods. Number one is heat treatment.
Heat processing is widely accepted as an effective means of inactivating the
thermolabile anti-nutritional factors in food material.  This improves the
protein quality by inactivating anti- physiological factors particularly
trypsin inhibitor and haemagglutinins and by unfolding the protein structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Heat treatment processes includes boiling,
autoclaving, pressure cooking, extrusion cooking and toasting. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now boiling, cooking generally inactivates
heat-sensitive anti-nutritive factors such as trypsin and chymotrypsin
inhibitors and volatile compounds. Cooking for sixty minutes at hundred degrees
centigrade was reported to be sufficient to inactivate over ninety percent of
the trypsin inhibitor activity in food materials. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The second method is autoclaving, autoclaving
under pressure for thirty minutes at one twenty-five degree centigrade and
fifteen-pound pressure destroys the thermo-labile inhibitory substances such as
cyanogenic glycosides, saponins, terpenoids, and alkaloids. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now simple pressure cooking. that is pressure
cooking under pressure for thirty minutes is known to removes trypsin
inhibitors in food. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then microwave treatment- microwave ovens use
frequencies of two point four five and a wavelength is twelve point two
centimetres for ten minutes in order to eliminate the trypsin inhibitor and the
haemagglutinating activity in food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now extrusion cooking is also used to eliminate
the entry nutrient factors in foods, the cooking process in this takes place
within the excluder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to
the pressure that is generated that is ten to twenty bars of pressure. The
process can induce both protein denaturation and starch gelatinization as well
as, complete inactivation of haemagglutinins in food materials. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then coming to the next major procedure that
is without the use of heat soaking. Soaking could be one of the processes to
remove the soluble anti-nutritional factors- seeds soaked in water at twenty
two degrees centigrade for a period of eighteen hours were reported to decrease
trypsin inhibitor activity in food. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then germination or sprouting is another
procedure used to eliminate, the anti-nutrient factors. Germination has been
documented to be an effective treatment to remove some anti-nutritional factors
in legumes by mobilizing secondary metabolic compounds. which are thought to
function as reserve nutrients. Germination can also lower the phytate content
in legume seeds depending upon the type of beam and the germinating conditions.
The structure of anti-nutritional factors and their chemical properties
specially heat liability. Dictate which physical process will be more effective
in their reduction or removal, thereby minimizing the adverse biological
effects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now let us see the different treatments in use
to deactivate the anti-nutritional compounds, which are summarized in table
two. This table shows the bioactive substance and the commonly used elimination
process. For if the bioactive substances enzyme inhibitors then heat treatment
can be used for its elimination, as we have discussed earlier. For phytic acid
enzymatic degradation, germination and fermentation can be used, for eliminating
its anti-nutrient activity. Now for oxalate cooking and dehulling are the
procedures that are recommended for elimination of anti-nutrient activity, then
for phenolic compounds dehulling. For saponins, sprouting and for lectins heat
treatment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now further to this brief discussion on anti
nutrients in foods, the upcoming modules will explain in greater details the
structure, mechanism of action sources, adverse or beneficial effects and the
processing techniques, to make food safe for the consumer.  Let us now conclude
this module on anti-nutritional factors. Anti-nutritional factors are described
as compounds or substances which act to reduce nutrient intake digestion,
absorption and utilization and may produce other adverse effects. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now the anti-nutritional factors we have seen
in plants may be classified either on the basis of the structure or their
actions the which bring about or their origin. Now the balance between
beneficial and hazardous effects of plant bioactive and anti-nutrients rely on
the concentration, chemical structure, time of exposure and interaction with
other dietary components. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Elimination of anti-nutritional factors in
foods can be achieved either by selection of bland genotype with low levels of
such factors or through post-harvesting processing like germination, boiling,
leaching, fermentation, extraction etcetera. Knowledge regarding processing
techniques to reduce the content of anti-nutritional factors in food is needed
for health and well-being of the population. Technological strategies in order
to obtain toxin-free products are urgently warranted.</span></p>
