<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&#65279;Dear learners, last module you learn
about introduction, sources and the effect of processing. In this module, you
shall study the beneficial effects of phytates. Phytic acid is found in
cereals, legumes, nuts and oilseed constitutes up to one to five percent of the
weight of cereals or oilseeds. And serves as, the chief storage form of
phosphorus. Phytic acid has a long been considered an anti nutrient, mainly due
to its ability to bind with many divalent cations, proteins and starch, And to
consequently reduce their bioavailability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This binding ability is attributed to phytic
acids highly negatively charged phosphorylated structure. To combat phytic
acids anti-nutrient effects, particularly in nutritionally compromised
populations, many ways of removing it from foods have been suggested. However,
it has also been suggested by many studies that consumption of phytic acid may
convey some beneficial health effects. The possible beneficial effects of food
phytates include lowering of serum cholesterol and triglycerides and protection
against certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease, renal stone formation
and certain types of cancer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This module will acquaint learners with,
mechanism of phytate hydrolysis in the gut and absorption and physiological
effects of phytates. Mechanism of phytate hydrolysis in the gut. Studies in
human showed that thirty seven to sixty six percent of dietary phytate is
regarded during digestion in the stomach, and small intestine. When the diet is
rich in plant food phytases in humans, the main phytate hydrolysis occur in the
large intestine by means of microbial phytases. Due to the stepwise
degradation, of dietary phytate in the gut large number of inositol phosphates
are formed. Among, the inositol phosphates typically formed by three and six
phytases. Other inositol phosphate such as del inositol P four and del inositol
P three are formed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The higher phosphorylated inositol phosphates
are the lower the solubility of their metal complexes in the gastrointestinal
chyme. Consequently, high phosphorylated inositol phosphates and especially phytic
acid bind strongly to minerals and trace elements. Under the acidic conditions,
of gastric chyme and form soluble complexes. During the passage from the
stomach to the small intestine and the increasing pH they precipitate. Thus,
the availability of bound trace elements and minerals is reduced. The
intestinal absorption of these elements affected under certain dietary
conditions and imbalanced nutrition. This may lead to serious deficiencies of
these elements in humans and animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now let us see the absorption. The phytate
absorption in the gut is very low and does not exceed a few percent. Whether
phytate or other inositol phosphates might be absorbed via active transport,
pinocytosis or other ways of absorption or by combination of these also remains
to be clarified. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Next, we will go through the physiological
effects. Research has traditionally focused on its structure that gives its
ability to bind minerals, proteins and starch.  And thus lowers absorption of
these elements. The first physiological effect is phytate and its mineral
interaction. Phytate is a strong chelator of divalent minerals such as copper,
calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Several in vitro and in vivo studies in
animals and humans clearly indicate that phytates decreases mineral bioavailability
by forming complexes with these minerals. Many of phytate mineral complexes
become unavailable for absorption under normal physiological conditions. It
contribute mineral deficiencies in people whose diets rely on these foods for
their mineral intake, such as those in developing countries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The effect of phytic acid on mineral
availability depends on numerous factors. They are, amount of phytic acid
present in it, concentration of minerals, molar ratio phytic acid to minerals,
size and valency, presence of other metal ions, presence of other substances
which can bind minerals, example.  fiber, tannins, oxalic acid and even
processing methods used. At the pH values between five and seven which are
similar to those in the duodenum phytic acid bind and forms insoluble chelates
which divalent cations. At pH seven point four, the order complexion is
decreasing order which is copper, zinc, cobalt, manganese, iron and the last
calcium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Next interaction with niacin. It also acts as
an acid chelating the vitamin niacin, which is basic, causing a condition known
as pellagra. This was observed people with a particularly low intake of
essential minerals, especially young children and those in developing
countries. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Next, phytates and protein interaction. phytates
are ionic in nature, they also react directly with charge group of proteins or
indirectly with the negatively charged group of proteins, mediated by a
positively charged mineral ion such as calcium. The resultant phytate protein
and phytate mineral protein complexes may also adversely influence protein
digestion and bioavailability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And the next one is phytate and starch
interaction. Phytate can also bind with starch either directly by hydrogen
bonding with a phosphate group or indirectly through the proteins, which may
result in a decrease of start solubility and digestibility. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now let's conclude this topic. In this module,
we have learned the hydrolysis of phytate which occurs in the small and large
intestine by means of plant or microbial phytases. During the stepwise
degradation of dietary phytates in the gut large number of inositol phosphates
are formed. We have also studied the physiological effects of phytates. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Several factors are present which govern the
inhibitory effect of phytate on mineral bioavailability, pH content of minerals
and phytates solubility of phytates and moreover great variation exist for the
affinity of phytate complex with different balance cations, showing increasing
binding strength from mono to multivalent cations. Furthermore, different
phytate mineral ratios in foods and diets seem to be also important for phytate
inhibition of the intestinal absorption of minerals and trace elements. The
phytate concentration in the diet has to exceed a certain level to have a substantial
effect and the bioavailability of minerals and trace elements.</span></p>
