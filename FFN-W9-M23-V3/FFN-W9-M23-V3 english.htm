<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&#65279;In previous module, you learn about
mechanism of phytate hydrolysis in the gut and absorption, and also learned its
physiological effects of phytates. In this module, you are going to know about
the beneficial effects of phytates. For decades phytate has been regarded as an
anti-nutrient, as during gastrointestinal passage it may inhibit the absorption
of some essential trace elements and minerals, which under certain dietary
circumstances may lead to calcium, iron, and zinc deficiencies. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Thus, intensive research has been carried out
to remove phytate from food, by proper processing to improve the bioavailability
and to avoid deficiencies of essential trace elements and minerals. In the last
twenty years, however, beneficial properties of phytates have been observed and
antioxidant and anti-cancer activities were reported. Inhibition of calcium
salt crystallization and prevention of renal stone formation through dietary
phytate were described. Reduction of starch digestion along with slowing down
of glycemic index of foods have also been reported. As well as positive effects
on blood glucose and blood cholesterol. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In this module, we shall study the beneficial
effects of phytates. Phytic acid is known Anti-oxidant. Colonic bacteria
produce oxygen radicals in appreciable accounts. Dietary phytic acid suppresses
free radical mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium. For example,
because, phytates can chelate copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and
several other minerals. And many of these minerals are essential cofactors for
numerous oxidoreductases, several investigators have suggested that phytates may
act as an antioxidant in vivo. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Such antioxidant activity has been suggested
to be responsible for free radical scavenging action in vivo that may lead to
anti-cancer activity. Mineral chelating ability of phytates has also been
suggested to be responsible for antimicrobial (like mold inhibition, for
example) activity. Protective benefits are seen particularly in relation to
carcinogenesis,  particularly against the colon cancers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Complexing of iron-catalyzed production of
free radicals and reduce lipid peroxidation. Lower blood glucose and lipids,
binding amylase reducing starch digestion,  lowering plasma cholesterol, and
triglycerides. In the figure, you can observe, possible mechanism of phytic
acid on protein binding, starch binding, and mineral binding as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now we will discuss, perceived effects of
phytic acid in risk reduction of diseases. Reduction in cancer risk, different
cancers especially colon and breast cancer has been linked to phytates. 
Endogenous phytic acid derived from high dietary fiber foods such as wheat bran
along with exogenous pure phytic acid added to a low fiber diet, maybe colon
cancer protective. Phytic acid consumption, as a part of diet, may potentially
lead to starch malabsorption resulting in colon content dilution. Increased
butyrate and decreased pH which could be potentially protective of colon from
carcinogenesis. Also due to its structure phytic acid can chelate polyvalent
cations, such as iron,  calcium, and zinc. These minerals are required for
vital cellular functions and they chelation may affect mineral vital to DNA
synthesis and cell growth, maybe a factor in studies that have shown in
decrease in cell proliferation, with phytic acid supplementation. Phytic acid
may also exert its effects by affecting the immune system. Enhancement of
natural killer cell activity has been shown in carcinogen treated mice fed with
phytic acid, and in vitro when splenocytes from normal mice were treated with
phytic acid.  Purified phytic acid has been shown in in-vitro studies to inhibit
cell growth,  and increase cell differentiation and maturation of HT29 human
colon carcinoma cells. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Learners, let us see the effect of phytic acid
on heart disease. A High Zinc Copper ratio has been linked to
hypercholesterolemia. Thus, by virtue of its ability to bind these divalent
cations and potentially alter their balance and availability, phytic acid may
also affect serum cholesterol levels. The ability of phytic acid to chelate
iron and possibly reduce its free radical generating potential and subsequent
lipid peroxidation damage may also protect the heart from ischemic and
reperfusion injury. It has also been suggested that the calcium-binding ability
of phytic acid may help to reduce the level of calcium in soft tissue prone to
calcification. Seely suggested that calcification of aorta may lead to loss of
elasticity and development of hypertension. It is argued that phytic acid may
bind excess calcium, reduce the level of aortic calcification and improve
hypertension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now we will go through hypoglycemic effects of
phytic acid. Of the different carbohydrate foods tested for starch
digestibility and blood glucose response the rich in anti-nutrients example,
legumes show the lowest values. Amylase inhibitors can reduce blood glucose and
raise insulin levels. Phytic acid may play an important role in the inhibition,
of starch digestion and absorption. It can bind to starch, either by hydrogen
bonding indirectly via proteins, it is bound to or by inhibiting the proper
digestion and hence absorption of starch, by binding amylase or enzyme
cofactors such as, Ca2 .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Any starch that is not digested and absorbed
in the small intestine would probably lessen the glucose absorption at that
site. Thus, decreasing the glycemic effect and the required insulin response.
This is of consequence not only in diabetes but also in heart disease. Because
reductions in plasma glucose and insulin may lead to lower hepatic lipid
synthesis. The hypoglycemic effects of phytic acid may also contribute to its
hypolipidemic effects described above. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The final topic of this module is effect of
phytic acid on other diseases. By virtue of its mineral binding abilities
phytic acid may also aid in the prevention of renal calculi. Phytic acid has
been shown in vitro to best prevent brushite, a form of calcium phosphate and
component of renal calculi crystallization and precipitation.  Calcium and
fluoride binding by phytic acid can insolubilize the minerals, and therefore
may be useful in the development of dental enamels. Phytate and Sialolithiasis,
Sialolithiasis is a common disease of salivary glands. Little is known about
aetiology of this calculi and their exact mechanism of formation is unknown. 
It was concluded that a deficit of crystallization inhibitors, such as phytate
is also an important aetiologic factor of sialolith development.  Phytic acid
also forms an iron chelate, that suppresses lipid peroxidation by blocking iron
driven hydroxyl radical generation. The primary mechanism by which the
beneficial health effects of phytates maybe, explained is the strong mineral
collecting ability of phytates. Calcium and fluoride binding by phytic acid can
insolublize the minerals and therefore may be useful in the development of
dental enamels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Let's, look into our conclusion of the sub
contents of the phytates. Phytate is a food component, that is considered an
anti nutrient, by virtue of its ability to chealate, divalent minerals and
prevent their bioavailability.  Thus intensive research has been carried out to
remove phytates from food by proper processing, to improve the bioavailability,
and to avoid deficiencies of essential trace elements and minerals.  Studies
showed inhibition of calcium salt crystallization, and prevention of renal
stone formation through dietary phytates. Reduction of starch digestion along
with slowing down of glycemic index of foods have also been reported, as well
as positive effects on blood glucose and blood cholesterol were also shown. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The phytate concentration, in the diet, has to
exceed a certain level, to have a substantial effect on bioavailability of
minerals and trace elements. In healthy individuals taking balanced diet the
effect of phytic acid on inhibition of mineral absorption is minimal, and does
not cause any nutrient deficiencies. Lastly to reduce the anti-nutrient effects
of phytic acid in foods, the procedures like soaking, sprouting, fermentation,
and consuming vitamin C rich food, enhance mineral absorption, and offset
phytic acid. </span></p>
